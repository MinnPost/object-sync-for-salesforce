Changelog
=========

* 1.3.6 (2018-05-16)
	* Bug fix: this release fixes an issue where the plugin can fail to save setting values in older WordPress versions, which keeps it from ever being activated. Thanks to WordPress user @amstertam for bringing this to our attention.

* 1.3.5 (2018-04-25)
	* Bug fix: this release fixes an issue where the plugin can fail to map certain fields in certain cases when the Salesforce value it is attempting to save in WordPress is empty.

* 1.3.4 (2018-04-14)
	* Bug fix: this release refixes an issue in which a custom post object with custom fields was not sending its custom fields on the first save, causing it to fail if the fields were required in Salesforce. Thanks to WordPress users @rtd2 and @bill5roses for reporting that the previous fix was not sufficient.

* 1.3.3 (2018-03-31)
	* Bug fix: a modified Salesforce Contact, which is not mapped to a user in WordPress but when the fieldmap does exist, would try to create a new user in WordPress but fail to add the email address to the email field. Thanks to GitHub user @mcculloughcm for the report.
	* Bug fix: the key and prematch fields were ignored if their Salesforce status was not updateable, so this broke prematch checking in those cases. Thanks to GitHub user @johnpbloch for the report.
	* New: small tweaks to plugin readme, inline form text.

* 1.3.2 (2018-03-16)
	* Bug fix: this plugin would sometimes conflict with jQuery from other plugins, especially older ones. This puts the object into an enclosure instead.
	* Bug fix: allow mapped date fields to be empty without causing a push error.
	* Bug fix: make sure plugin notices only appear on pages related to this plugin.
	* Bug fix: doing an import with only one object map would fail.

* 1.3.1 (2018-03-11)
	* Bug fix: this release fixes an issue in which a custom post object with custom fields was not sending its custom fields on the first save, causing it to fail if the fields were required in Salesforce. Thanks to WordPress user @rtd2 for reporting this.
	* Bug fix: this release makes the data import preserve the field structure.

* 1.3.0 (2018-03-10)
	* New: this release adds an interface for importing and exporting plugin data. It includes fieldmaps (which map object types to each other), object maps (individual objects mapped to each other) and plugin settings. Data is exported to a single JSON file that can be imported.
	* Bug fix: this release supports a datetime change in MySQL versions newer than 5.7.4 in which default values can no longer be 0000-00-00. See this [StackOverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25349126/how-can-i-set-the-default-value-of-a-field-as-0000-00-00-000000) for details.
	* Bug fix: this release fixes an issue where admin notices for this plugin would sometimes be empty.
	* Also fixed a ton of code formatting stuff, including translation spots.
	* This release also fixes the previously broken Travis CI build's issues with older PHP versions.

* 1.2.8 (2018-03-09)
	* New: this release adds a new developer hook, `object_sync_for_salesforce_push_update_params_modify`, which allows the data being pushed to Salesforce to be modified in the event that an existing Salesforce object is being updated.
	* Bug fix: the install script adds `--prefer-dist` to the `composer install` to hopefully prevent issues on Pantheon. Thanks to WordPress user @joepahl for reporting this.
	* This releasse also makes a number of corrections and clarifications to the plugin documentation.

* 1.2.7 (2018-02-23)
	* Bug fix: in some cases, a fieldmap with the Salesforce update trigger checked, but not the Salesforce create trigger, it would still create data in WordPress. This data should, rather, be skipped.
	* New: there are also a number of small tweaks to in-page help, documentation and code comments.

* 1.2.6 (2018-01-30)
	* Bug fix: in some cases, date fields coming from Salesforce were not correctly formatted for use in WordPress. This release causes any core date fields to be formatted as WordPress expects them. Thanks to GitHub user @prowp for the report on this.
	* Note: to apply this fix, you need to clear the plugin cache, and then re-save any the fieldmap(s) that need it.
	* This release also includes a small documentation update about restricted picklist fields.

* 1.2.5 (2018-01-26)
	* Bug fix: trying to save a high number of fields in a single fieldmap was failing. Thanks to GitHub user @prowp for the report.
	* New: some in-page help to users who may be missing meta fields when trying to add them to a fieldmap. This happens if these meta fields are new fields without data, and thus cannot be found in the database by the plugin.
	* New: we now store the plugin version in the database when saving a fieldmap. This allows us to check fieldmaps to make sure they use the most up to date schema.

* 1.2.4 (2018-01-24)
	* This release fixes a rare bug in which Salesforce changes that occur between a query and the completion of the pull operation would not sync to WordPress. Thanks to GitHub user @charmoney for the report and the fix.
	* This release also removes the "weight" field from the screen that adds and edits fieldmaps. This field should have been removed in the past, as it doesn't currently do anything, although in the future we'd like to investigate the ability to map multiple WordPress objects to the same Salesforce object and sync them using the weight field.

* 1.2.3 (2018-01-19)
	* This release fixes a bug in which deleting field pairs from an existing fieldmap, saving, and then adding more field pairs could result in data not being saved. Thanks to WordPress user @pavelwld for reporting this.
	* This release also adds a Settings tab field to choose whether or not the plugin should delete its data when it is deactivated.

* 1.2.2 (2018-01-17)
	* This release fixes a bug in which an object map could not be created if the Salesforce ID was the same, with case insensitivity, as another Salesforce ID. Salesforce, however, is case sensitive with these IDs and can occasionally create IDs like this. Thanks to WordPress user @pavelwld for reporting this.

* 1.2.1 (2017-12-19)
	* This release fixes a bug caused in 1.2.0. Users were unable to sync data without re-saving fieldmaps. This does a version checker and uses previous data structures until users re-save.
	* Make sure you update your plugin fieldmaps.

* 1.2.0 (2017-12-18)
	* This release provides basic support for additional field types in Salesforce, including: multipicklist, picklist, date, datetime, and URL (results may vary depending on how WordPress plugins handle their custom field equivalents). Thanks to WordPress user @ilanabit for reporting this.
	* This release also forces InnoDB on the `field_map` table because MyISAM gets errors on the index length. Hopefully most users are already on InnoDB by default, but this will help any users who are not.

* 1.1.2 (2017-11-20)
	* Clarify the documentation, and the code, for the following developer hooks:
		* `object_sync_for_salesforce_add_more_wordpress_types`
		* `object_sync_for_salesforce_remove_wordpress_types`
		* `object_sync_for_salesforce_wordpress_object_data`
	* Thanks to WordPress user @justanothercoder for asking about this, leading to the fix.

* 1.1.1 (2017-11-17)
	* This release removes the `screen_icon()` method from admin.php. It has been deprecated apparently since 3.8, but in 4.9 it officially throws PHP Notice messages in `WP_DEBUG` mode.

* 1.1.0 (2017-11-10)
	* This release gives users a way to clear the cached data for this plugin only, even if they are using an object cache method. Most importantly this resolves the problem of new fields being available in Salesforce or WordPress and not being visible in the list of mappable fields when creating or updating a fieldmap. This is partly related to GitHub user @prowp's initial report of missing metadata.

* 1.0.11 (2017-11-06)
	* Fixed a bug in which a blank `post` object was created in the event that `pull` calls were blocked, then unblocked. Thanks to GitHub user @charmoney for the report and much of the fix.
	* Fixed a bug in which `post` meta fields were not pushed to Salesforce. Also as part of this, added basic support for WooCommerce `order` post types. Thanks to WordPress user @ratputin and GitHub user @prowp for the report.

* 1.0.10 (2017-10-10)

	* This avoids repeatedly queueing Salesforce objects by initializing rather than aggregating the queue before saving. This reduces memory use and database size significantly.
	* Plugin now updates the pull sync timestamp for the data type after every successful record queue. This provides a correct starting point for the next pull to begin in case of a fatal error.
	* Thanks to GitHub user @charmoney for the report and the pull request.

* 1.0.9 (2017-10-03)

	* This fixes a bug in which upserting a custom post type would incorrectly create a standard post, rather than the desired custom post object. Thanks to GitHub user @prowp for the report.

* 1.0.8 (2017-08-14)

	* This checks a mapping's configured allowed sync triggers before queueing a record for pull processing, rather than as a part of the WordPress record's create or update. This resolves an issue. Thanks to GitHub user @charmoney for the report and the pull request.
	* This release also fixes a bug related to 1.0.7, which after the fix was still incorrectly checking the `post_content` and `post_title` values.

* 1.0.7 (2017-08-01)

	* This sets up admin notices that always show above the plugin's admin tabs if: 1) the plugin is not authorized, 2) there are no fieldmaps, or 3) there is no schedule set up for the plugin. This is so users understand they have to do these things before the plugin can properly work.
	* Fixed a bug where `wp_insert_post` failed if the `post_content` or `post_title` values were not passed, but the map row was still created. This passes empty values for both fields if they aren't present. It also throws a `WP_Errror` object if either `wp_insert_post` or `wp_update_post` fail.
	* Also fixed some code formatting issues

* 1.0.6 (2017-07-05)

	* This builds a basic interface for object map rows that failed to be fully created to map objects between the two systems, and have a temporary ID for either WordPress or Salesforce.
	* If any of these rows are present in the database, it creates a Mapping Errors tab at `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=object-sync-salesforce-admin&tab=mapping_errors`.
	* For each row, it shows the WordPress ID, WordPress object type, Salesforce ID, and when it was created. Users are able to edit each row's WordPress and/or Salesforce ID, in case the data they need to map does actually exist, and are also able to delete each row individually in case they just want to let the plugin run again.
	* This gives users a non SQL way to manage those error rows if they ever occur, on top of the previous PR on this branch that kept them from preventing further syncing.
	* **Noteworthy change:** in `salesforce_mapping` we now filter the `$posted` array so it only contains the columns in the database table for object maps, plus the `action` parameter that we filter out later. I've verified that the various `create_object_map` methods do not contain other parameters that we need to preserve for similar use to the `action`.

* 1.0.5 (2017-06-29)

	* Fixes an inconsistent scenario in which the plugin created object map rows with a WordPress or Salesforce ID of 0 and then failed to sync new objects because of the database key. Here's how:
		- Change the wordpress_id field on the map table to be a varchar instead of an integer (updating the plugin from the wordpress repo will automatically update this, but users who update manually will need to do it manually)
		- when creating an object map between two items, plugin creates a temporary id value for whichever system does not have the item (ie a temporary wordpress id if we're on a salesforce pull action). This replaces the value of 0 that the plugin previously used before updating the database with the correct id value.
		- This way if the api fails, server goes down, whatever, that tmp id is unique down to the milisecond. The database key can stay, making sure duplicate ids do not get mapped and such, but in a worst case scenario there are rows that keep the temp id because the operation failed. They can be tracked down to when they happened and whether it was a push or pull that failed, by looking up that ID in the database.
	* Also updates documentation to be more clear about how the plugin works with data that exists prior to installation (mostly it doesn't, with some tiny manual exceptions).

* 1.0.4 (2017-06-12)

	* Fix the tested version again, as it was reverted

* 1.0.3 (2017-06-09)

	* Update the deploy file so it keeps .git, .gitignore, etc. items out of the deployed plugin

* 1.0.2 (2017-06-09)

	* Update tested WordPress version to reflect 4.8
	* Some basic preparation work for supporting the Salesforce SOAP API
	* Update dependencies

* 1.0.1 (2017-06-05)

	* made table summaries on API status page into translatable strings

* 1.0.0 (2017-05-30)

	* first stable release
