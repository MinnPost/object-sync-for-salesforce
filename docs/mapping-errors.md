# Mapping errors

If the plugin fails in the middle of creating a map between two objects, a row may be created on the Mapping Errors screen. If it is a push error, it will tell you the WordPress object ID it was trying to map. If it is a pull error, it will tell you the Salesforce ID.

If you have resolved an issue, you can put in the correct ID in place of the temporary one on the corresponding row, or you can delete the entry and let the plugin try the mapping again. **You should not leave these entries.**

The Mapping Errors tab has further explanation as well, when it is present. It will not appear in WordPress unless errors have occurred.
