# Initial Setup

## WordPress

### Prerequisites

To install the plugin in WordPress, your PHP environment needs the following:

#### To run the plugin on a website

1. At least version 5.6.20 of PHP.
2. At least version 5.2 of WordPress.
3. SSL support (this is required to connect to Salesforce). Contact your web host if you aren't sure if your website meets this requirement.
4. If you'll be using the SOAP API, PHP needs to be compiled with SOAP web services and
  OpenSSL support, as per:
  - [http://php.net/soap](http://php.net/soap)
  - [http://php.net/openssl](http://php.net/openssl)
5. A domain where WordPress is successfully running. For purposes of this documentation, we'll assume that you are using `https://<your site>`. You would use `https://www.example.com` instead, if your site was `www.example.com`.

### Activate the plugin

Once the plugin is installed, you will have an `object-sync-for-salesforce` folder in your `/wp-content/plugins` directory. In the Plugins list in WordPress, you can activate it and find the settings link (you can also find this plugin's settings in the main Settings list in WordPress, under the Salesforce menu item).

By default, the plugin's settings URL is `https://<your site>/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=object-sync-salesforce-admin`.

If you intend to contribute code for this plugin, or if you have installed it from GitHub, read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/MinnPost/object-sync-for-salesforce/blob/master/contributing.md) and follow these [additional developer guidelines for setup](./setup-for-developers.md).

## Salesforce

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have access to a Salesforce developer account. This should come with Enterprise Edition, Unlimited Edition, or Performance Edition. Developers can register for a free Developer Edition account at [https://developer.salesforce.com/signup](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).

We recommend using a Sandbox to set up this plugin first before running it in production.

For purposes of this documentation, we'll assume that your name, as defined in Salesforce, is Your Name. This is what you see at the top right of the browser window, when you are logged in.

### Create an App

1. In Salesforce, create a new Connected App. This differs between Lightning and Classic Salesforce.
    - **Lightning:** Click on the cog icon at the top right of the browser window and click on `Setup`. Then on the left sidebar, under `App Setup`, click `Platform Tools > Apps > App Manager`. In the **Lightning Experience App Manager** section of this page, click `New Connected App` to create a new app.
    - **Classic:** At the top right of the browser window, go to `Your Name > Setup`. Then on the left sidebar, under `App Setup`, click `Create > Apps`. In the **Connected Apps** section of this page, click New to create a new app.
2. Enable OAuth Settings
3. Set the callback URL to: `https://<your site>/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=object-sync-salesforce-admin&tab=authorize` (must use HTTPS).
4. Select at least "Perform requests on your behalf at any time" for OAuth Scope as well as the appropriate other scopes for your application. Most users of this plugin will also need to select "Manage user data via APIs (api)" as one of these scopes. Read more [about Salesforce OAuth scopes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_tokens_scopes.htm&type=5) in their documentation.

#### Get the values for WordPress

![Salesforce New Connected App settings](./assets/img/screenshots/01-salesforce-create-app.png)

After you save these settings, click Continue and you'll see the values for your new app. For WordPress, you'll need these values:

1. Consumer Key (in the screenshot, this value says "valuefromsalesforce")
2. Consumer Secret (you'll have to click "Click to reveal" to get this value, as indicated in the screenshot)

**Note:** it can take a few minutes for the app to be fully set up in Salesforce. If you get a `error=invalid_client_id&error_description=client%20identifier%20invalid` URL when you try to authorize with WordPress in the steps below, wait a few minutes and try again.

## Connect the plugin to Salesforce

### Settings

Go to the Settings tab for the plugin. It is the default URL that opens when you click Salesforce in the main Settings menu. Enter the values based on your Salesforce environment.

1. Consumer Key: (your value from Salesforce)
2. Consumer Secret: (your value from Salesforce)
3. Callback URL: `https://<your site>/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=object-sync-salesforce-admin&tab=authorize`
4. Login Base URL: For most Salesforce environments, you can use `https://test.salesforce.com` for sandbox, and `https://login.salesforce.com` for production.
5. Authorize URL Path: The plugin starts with a default of `/services/oauth2/authorize`. You should generally not have to change this.
6. Token URL Path: The plugin starts with a default of `/services/oauth2/token`. You should generally not have to change this.
7. Limit Salesforce Objects: These allow you to indicate whether Salesforce should relate to objects that can't be triggered or updated via the API. Generally it's a good idea to have these boxes checked to avoid errors.
8. Salesforce Field Display Value: When mapping Salesforce fields, you can choose whether the plugin will display a field's Field Label (possibly a more user friendly value) or the API Name (which is always unique). Neither choice changes how the plugin functions on the back end, but making a choice can sometimes make the mapping choices easier to find.
9. Prevent Duplicate Field Mapping?: This checkbox allows you to prevent any WordPress or Salesforce field from being added to a fieldmap more than once. It does this by graying out any field once it has been selected.
10. Pull Query Record Limit: Limit the number of records that can be pulled from Salesforce in a single query.
11. Pull Throttle (In Seconds): This plugin starts with 5 seconds, but you can change it based on your server's needs.
12. Enable the Salesforce SOAP API?: In addition to its REST API, Salesforce maintains a SOAP-based API. Some functionality, namely record merges, can only be accessed through this API. If you need to detect these kind of events, enable the SOAP API with this field. If you do, you will see an optional Path to SOAP WSDL File field where you can override the default WSDL file.
13. Debug Mode: Debug mode activates logging for plugin events like Salesforce API requests and WordPress data operations. This can create a lot of log entries; it is not recommended to use it long-term in a production environment.
14. Delete Plugin Data on Uninstall?: When the plugin is uninstalled, by default it does not remove any data. If you want it to remove its custom tables, scheduling tasks, log post type, capability, and option values, check this box before you uninstall it.

Save the settings. If the values required are set, you'll see a message that says "Salesforce needs to be authorized to connect to this website. Use the Authorize tab to connect." You can use that link for the next steps.

#### Using constants for settings

You can set several of the above values as constants in your `wp-config.php` file. The plugin will always use a constant ahead of a database setting.

Supported constant names are:

1. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_CONSUMER_KEY
2. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_CONSUMER_SECRET
3. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_CALLBACK_URL
4. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_LOGIN_BASE_URL
5. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_AUTHORIZE_URL_PATH
6. OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_TOKEN_URL_PATH

Set them in `wp-config.php` like this:

```php
define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_CONSUMER_KEY', 'valuefromsalesforce');
define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_CONSUMER_SECRET', 'valuefromsalesforce');
define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_CALLBACK_URL', 'https://<your site>/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=object-sync-salesforce-admin&tab=authorize');
define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_LOGIN_BASE_URL', 'https://test.salesforce.com');
define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_AUTHORIZE_URL_PATH', '/services/oauth2/authorize');
define('OBJECT_SYNC_SF_SALESFORCE_TOKEN_URL_PATH', '/services/oauth2/token');
```

For any value that is already defined in `wp-config.php`, the Settings screen will display "Defined in wp-config.php" in place of the text field.

### Authorize

Go to the Authorize tab in the plugin's settings. If it is not yet authorized, you'll see a message that says "Salesforce needs to be authorized to connect to this website. Use the Authorize tab to connect."

The authorize tab will force you to be logged in using HTTPS, if you weren't already.

Steps:

1. Click the Connect to Salesforce button to authenticate WordPress with your Salesforce installation.
2. You may have to log into Salesforce.
3. Salesforce will ask you to allow access to the app (in these instructions, the name is WordPress Example), and will show you what permissions it needs.
4. Click Allow.
5. You'll be redirected back to WordPress. Don't do anything until you see a message that says "Salesforce is successfully authenticated."
6. The tab will display a "Disconnect from Salesforce" button which you can click at any time, and will also show a bit of basic information about your Salesforce environment.
